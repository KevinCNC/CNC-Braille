# CNC-Braille
FILES THAT CAN HELP THE ORDINARY CNC'R DO BRAILLE FOR SIGNAGE WITHOUT ALL OF THE EXPENSE.

I USE A CHEAP CHINESE CNC MACHINE RUNNING MACH 3 AND IT WORKS VERY WELL. TOTAL INVESTMENT IS LESS THEN $1000.

PLEASE CHECK ALL WORDING OF TEXT AT BRAILLETRANSLATOR.ORG FOR ACCURACY. IN NO WAY 
DO WE ACCEPT RESPOSABILITY FOR ANYTHING IN THESE FILES AND HAVE DONE OUR DUE DILIGENCE TO 
MAKE SURE THEY ARE ACCURATE AND FUNCTIONAL TO ADA STANDARDS, BUT WE'RE ALSO HUMAN AND PRONE TO ERROR. USE
AT YOUR OWN RISK AND DOUBLE CHECK OFTEN. IF YOU FIND ANY ERRORS THEN LET ME KNOW AND I'LL MAKE CORRECTIONS
AS SOON AND AS OFTEN AS I CAN.

I HAVE MADE A BRAILLE INSERTION TOOL I USE WITH GREAT SUCCESS AND WILL AT SOME POINT POST A "HOW TO" ON HERE BUT FOR THE TIME BEING
I'LL JUST GIVE A DESCRIPTION.

I USE A TWIST DRILL HOLDER WITH A PEICE CUT FROM A BALL AIR PUMP NEEDLE. IT'S JUST THE RIGHT SIZE. I RECESS THE TIP OF IT WITH A 1/16 INCH DRILL TO MATCH THE BRAILLE SPHERES. I CUT A PEICE FROM AN INK TUBE FOUND IN A TYPICAL BALL POINT PEN AND PUSHED IT OVER THE END TO HELP GRIP THE SPHERES AND SET THE DEPTH. I'VE ALSO TAKEN A VERY SMALL PEICE OF 3M DOUBLE SIDED TAPE (THE BOOGER STUFF) AND PUSHED IN THE TIP TO ACT AS TACK GRIP TO GRAB THE SPHERES. 

I ORDER 1.55MM DRILL MILLS FROM EBAY FOR ABOUT $1 EACH. IT'S THE PERFECT SIZE FOR A FRICTION HOLD ON THE BRAILLE SPHERE (I NEVER GLUE). GET THE ONES WITH THE CERAMIC/PLASTIC COLLAR AS IT HELPS INSURE YOUR BIT DOESN'T SLIP UPWARDS. IF THE HOLE IS NOT DEEP ENOUGH JUST PUT THE BIT ON A DRILL AND DEEPEN THE HOLE CAREFULLY

LOOK TO THE BIG SUPPLIERS FOR 1/16TH ACRYLIC SPHERES. I DON'T SUPPORT MONOPOLIES.
