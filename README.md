# CNC-Braille
FILES THAT CAN HELP THE ORDINARY CNC'R DO BRAILLE FOR SIGNAGE WITHOUT ALL OF THE EXPENSE.

I USE A CHEAP CHINESE CNC MACHINE RUNNING MACH 3 AND IT WORKS VERY WELL. TOTAL INVESTMENT IS LESS THEN $1000.

I HAVE MADE A BRAILLE INSERTION I USE WITH GREAT SUCCESS AND WILL AT SOME POINT POST A "HOW TO" ON HERE BUT FOR THE TIME BEING
I JUST GIVE A DESCRIPTION.

I USE A TWIST DRILL HOLDER WITH A PEICE CUT FROM A BALL AIR PUMP NEEDLE. IT'S JUST THE RIGHT SIZE. I CUT A PEICE FROM AN INK TUBE IN A TYPICAL BALL POINT PEN AND PUSHED IT OVER THE END TO HELP GRIP THE SPHERES AND SET THE DEPTH OF SET. I'VE ALSO TAKEN A VERY SMALL PEICE OF 3M DOUBLE SIDED TAPE AND PUSHED IN THE TIP TO ACT AS TACK GRIP TO GRAB THE SPHERES. 

I ORDER 1.55MM DRILL MILLS FROM EBAY FOR ABOUT $1 EACH. IT'S THE PERFECT SIZE FOR A FRICTION HOLD ON THE BRAILLE SPHERE. GET THE ONES WITH THE CERAMIC/PLASTIC COLLAR AS IT HELPS INSURE YOUR BIT DOESN'T SLIP.

LOOK TO THE BIG SUPPLIERS FOR 1/16TH ACRYLIC SPHERES MCMASTER CARR ETC.
